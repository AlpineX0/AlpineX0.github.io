		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p style="padding:40px; font-size: 18px;">I've always had a strong interest in mathematics and programming, so naturally, I decided to study Computer Science. Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, playing video games, and watching documentaries. My favorite programming language is Java but I also have experience with C and Assembly.</p>

				<h3>Team Project - Thermal Terrain Imaging</h3>
				<p>This is a team project aimed at developing a system that uses thermal imaging technology to map the temperature variations of different terrains. The objective is to create a comprehensive and accurate thermal map that can be used in various fields, such as agriculture, geology, and environmental studies. The project involves designing and building a custom hardware system that can capture and process thermal images, as well as developing software to interpret and analyze the data collected by the system. The team will work together to optimize the system's performance and accuracy, and ultimately produce a highly useful tool for researchers and professionals.</p>

				<h3>Personal Project - Mathematical Expression Interpreter</h3>
				<p>Inspired by my love for mathematics, I created a project that evaluates mathematical expressions. The implementation is in Java and it handles basic arithmetic, parentheses, exponentiation, and other mathematical functions. This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my skills in object-oriented programming and algorithm design.</p>
